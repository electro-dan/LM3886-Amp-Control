v1.0 5th Mar 2014
- Release version, live and Running
- Untested bluetooth

v1.1 2nd May 2016, 7th Aug 2016
- Save power by switching relays off after power off
- Renames
- RS232 receive nibble fix
- RS232 power on fix

v2.0 3rd May 2017
For new PIC and circuit boards
- Revision of pins
- TODO: Interrupt priority
  - high priority for DC and PWR fail
  - low priority for all others (disable during power on sequence)
- TODO: Added speaker protection interrupt
  - Interrupt routine
  - Fault to LED display
- TODO: Bluetooth AT commands
- TODO: PIC reduced power consumption
   - INTOSC used to set low speed clock
     - IRCF2:IRCF0 : 110 = 4 MHz
   - RC_RUN mode - SCS1:SCS0 bits set to �10�
   - PRI_RUN - SCS1:SCS0 bits set to �00�
- TODO: Adjust relay pins

v2.0 2nd Apr 2018
- Added dedicated mute feature

v2.1 28th Jun 2018
- Changed configuration to reduce power consumption - disabled PLL, reduced clock to 10MHz and adjusted timers, baud
- Added trigger support

v2.2 8th Jul 2018
- Tweaks to volume adjust increments by IR, LED delay and relay at power on

v2.3 9th Sep 2018
- Adjusted MAX7219 LED char delay and added extra clear at power off to clear display to try to improve LED reliability
v2.3.1 13th Sep 2018 [not programmed]
- Adjusted MAX7219 LED char delay further
v2.3.2 22nd/24th Sep 2018
- Added MAX7219 LED char init test
- Default 1 for trigger 1
v2.3.4 15th Oct 2018 [live]
- Adjusted timings and code for MAX7219

v2.4 18th Mar 2019
- Added delay before input relays/triggers close
- Renamed inputs

v2.5 3rd Mar 2024
- Added second write of volume during power on (very occasionally first write not applied due to intererence)

Fix list:
x Not reponding to DC fail
x Not working in low power mode
x RS232 ignoring second character after command (e.g. V99 goes V90)
x Switch to timer based RC2 IR receive
x EEPROM not saving
x Input relays click after power on
x Sometimes second display does not initiate
x Add triggers x2
x Rear balance/level variance at power on
